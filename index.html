<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: November 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Tap2Talk</strong>, developed by <strong>Bright Speech Labs</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how the Tap2Talk AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) app handles your information. We are committed to keeping your data private, secure, and stored only on your device unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>Tap2Talk does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any of the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal details such as your name, email, phone number, or address</li>
    <li>Photos, contact lists, or media files</li>
    <li>Voice recordings or AAC messages created inside the app</li>
    <li>Precise location data</li>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
    <li>Advertising data or analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>All communication content and custom boards generated inside the app remain on your device.</p>

<h2>2. Information That May Be Collected Automatically</h2>
<p>Because Tap2Talk is distributed through the Google Play Store, some anonymous data may be collected automatically by Google, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Crash logs</li>
    <li>Installation statistics</li>
    <li>Device model and OS version</li>
</ul>
<p>Tap2Talk does not directly access, store, or control this information. Handling of this data is governed by Google’s own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
<p>If anonymous diagnostic information is available through Google Play, it may be used solely to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improve app performance</li>
    <li>Identify and fix crashes</li>
    <li>Enhance accessibility and reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your information for advertising, tracking, profiling, or marketing.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties.  
Any information handled by Google Play is managed according to Google's policies and not by Bright Speech Labs.</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Tap2Talk is designed to be safe for users of all ages, including children and individuals with communication support needs.  
Since the app does not collect personal information, it complies with regulations such as COPPA by default.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>Since Tap2Talk does not store personal data on external servers, your communication data remains on your device and is protected by your device’s built-in security features.</p>

<h2>7. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy as the app evolves. Any changes will be reflected on this page, with the updated date shown at the top.</p>
